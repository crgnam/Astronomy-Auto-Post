This was my first time trying to image and process a comet. I definitely learned a lot and am reasonably happy with the result! This is a composite of 2 images: One where I aligned and stacked on the comet, and one where I aligned and stacked on the stars. I found that I got better results by stacking the comet in batches of every 5th image as it allowed me to better reject the stars since they weren't overlapping.
